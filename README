This is Trojitá, a Qt IMAP e-mail client.

To build for xTuple Connect:
- Install CMake if you don't have it already
- `git clone https://github.com/xtuple/trojita`
- `cd trojita`
- verify that xTuple's default branch is checked out
- `mkdir build`
- `cmake ../CMakeLists.txt`
- `make`

We still need to work out bundling issues.
