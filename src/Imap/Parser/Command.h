 * In IMAP, each command consists of several chunks of data to be sent over the wire. There are different
 * rules on how to transfer them -- some data can be just flushed to the wire as byte arrays without any
 * further processing, but there are places where the transmission just cannot happen "right now". An
 * example of this are huge blobs of binary data which need to be transmitted as synchronizing literals.
 * These literals need to wait for the server's explicit OK to send them, and the client is forbidden to
 * send them ahead.
 *
 * This class therefore encapsulates the "part of command" along with enough information on how it should
 * be transfered.
