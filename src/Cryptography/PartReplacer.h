    /** @short Mangle the MIME part if desirable

    The implementations of this interface checks if it is desirable to override the @arg original MIME part with
    a custom specification. If not, the @arg original shall be returned without modification.

    The MessageModel is in an inconsistent state at the time this method is called; the @arg original is actually
    *not* included within the list of its parent's children (the children of @arg parentPart are undefined). Care
    should be taken to not access the proxy indexes below the @arg proxyParentIndex. On the other hand, it is safe
    to use the @arg original to request data from the proxied part, including calling its row().

    If this module wants to override the MIME part (maybe based on its MIME type, maybe based on some ad-hoc criteria),
    it should return a replacement part. Note that other part replacers might override this decision by overwriting
    the returned objects. Resource management is taken care of by the unique_ptr interface.

    The @arg sourceItemIndex points to an index within the source model (that is *not* the MessageModel) which
    represents the current item (see @arg original).

    The @arg proxyParentIndex represents a parent of @arg original within the MessageModel. There is no index
    representing the current item within the MessageModel because this method is called at the time the model
    is not in a consistent shape, and therefore accessing its MVC methods for siblings of "this" item (i.e.,
    children of @arg proxyParentIndex) is not safe.
