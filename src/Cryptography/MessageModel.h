 *
 * This model mimics the structure of a source model and has some provisions for adding custom
 * subtree items as replacements for arbitrary nodes (not just leaves). Internally, each node is
 * represented either by a LocalMessagePart (for those items which were added manually as
 * replacements) or ProxyMessagePart (for those items which are just proxies pointing back to the
 * original model, with unmodified position).
 *
 * This model makes a couple of assumptions. It doesn't support dynamic models at all; any removed
 * or added row/column/whatever in the source model will likely end up in a segfault.
